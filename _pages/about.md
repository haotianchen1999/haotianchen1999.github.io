* I'm a math teacher at Guangzhou Zhixin High School in Guangzhou, China.
* Previsouly, I received my Bachelor's degree at Peking University, School of Mathematical Sciences.
* I was born in July 1999, Hunan, China. I grew up in [Yueyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yueyang).
* My current research mainly lies in the intersection of formal methods, machine learning, and control theory, with the goal of building safe autonomous systems. I also enjoy studying the general area of theoretical computer science. Particularly I am interested in the following several directions:
  * Learning-based safe planning and control for autonomous system
  * Building formal method guided trustworthy and reliable AI system
  * Formal verification and synthesis for discrete-events systems
* My Chinese name is 陈浩天 (ch&eacute;n h&agrave;o tian), where 陈 (y&aacute;ng) is my family name and 浩天 (h&agrave;o tian) is my given name. 
* Please find my resume [here](https://shuoyang2000.github.io/files/ShuoYang_CV.pdf) and let me know if you want to collaborate with me. You could contact me via email: cht0709 AT pku DOT edu DOT cn
